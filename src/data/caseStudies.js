            introduction: [
                "Nutrition is the most enunciated topic spoken around the world, everyone wants to eat nutritious chemical-free food, and farmers also want to produce what is beneficial for their soil and land, a food which is chemical and pesticide-free, their main focus across India is to get maximum yield with minimum input cost.",
                "Nutrition Bio Systems is a new bird in farming, but it comes with the strong backing of its promoter company, Nutri Tech Solutions, with 40 years of experience in 55 countries in the field of Nutrition Farming. Australia's leading provider of cutting-edge agricultural products and services.",
                "Nutrition Bio Systems has a wide range of products for Plant Nutrition, Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition.",
                "In May 2015, we prepared model farms for Paddy Crop in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh and Lakhimpur Kheri, India. The tests were done with high-quality seeds to produce paddy crops. Analysis was done over 26 acres on different plots in and around the area of Jewar."
            ],
            methodology: [
                "The trial was conducted on a total of 26 acres, with 13 acres using our Magic Box Paddy Kit and the remaining 13 acres following conventional farming methods.",
                "Each Magic Box Paddy Kit was applied to 1 acre of land.",
                "Primary data for this research was collected from trial fields in Jewar and Lakhimpur Kheri.",
                "The model farms using the Magic Box Paddy Kit strictly adhered to the recommended application methods.",
                "The same variety of virgin seeds was used in both the control (conventional farming) and treated (Magic Box Paddy Kit) farms."
            ],
            analysis: "The NBS Magic Paddy Kit increased paddy yield by 25%–30% due to its scientifically formulated components. Yield Booster (organic matter, organic carbon, potassium) enhanced soil fertility and nutrient uptake, while Bio Protect (organic matter, mineral potassium, phosphorus) strengthened plant immunity and stress tolerance. Bio Simulator (organic matter, organic carbon) improved microbial activity and root development, and Bug Shield (NPK) ensured balanced nutrition and pest resistance. This synergy led to healthier crops, improved grain quality, and higher productivity compared to conventional farming.",
            keyFindings: [
                "The paddy plants treated with the NBS Kit exhibited strong resistance to diseases and pest infestations",
                "Enhanced vigor, improved immunity, and overall better physiological development",

                "The Paddy Crop matured 30 days before the controlled plot paddy crop",
                "Reduced use of pesticides, saving significant costs for farmers"
            ],
            conclusion: [
                "The cost of the Magic kit was Rs 3000 to which the produce of 30% more, the water usage was less which saves cost on electricity and consumption on water, the soil quality improves, the use of pesticides per acre costs from Rs. 2000- Rs.3000, considering the base price saved on pesticides the cost of our Magic Kit marginalizes to Rs. 1,000/- per acre.",
                "Therefore the actual benefit is to the farmer is more than 30% in my assessment. The crop hence is healthier, tastier, shinier, bigger in size, almost chemical and pesticides free, has all the nutritious value."

Leonardite is the best quality raw humate as it is found relatively close to the surface and has undergone extensive oxidation to produce the most active organic carbon structure. Lignite brown coal is often sold as humate but it has undergone less oxidation, usually at greater depth, and is inferior in performance to Leonardite humates. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous dealers have tricked farmers into buying finely-ground, black coal as a cheap humate alternative, only to find that it is next to useless."

Potassium humate in NBS Sapphire Granules is a minimum of 75% w/w and is the preferred cation salt for plant use. Some humates are extracted using sodium hydroxide to form the soluble sodium humates. While sodium humates are ideal for livestock feed and support good rumen health and feed conversion ratios, they are not advised for use on plants."

An important benefit of soluble humates is to magnify and extend the nutrients in expensive, high-analysis fertilisers and trigger the release of soil nutrients previously locked-up by soil chemistry. Without a high degree of solubility, the humates cannot dissolve quickly with the granular fertilisers to act rapidly as a nutrient chelator and buffering agent. If the nutrients are not chelated and buffered quickly (by the action of a highly-soluble humate product) they remain exposed to soil reaction, leaching and volatilisation – a loss of valuable fertiliser during the monsoon and a waste of money for an inferior humate."

                    description: "NBS Sapphire Granules are 85-90% soluble, producing a dark viscous liquid that remains in solution. Upon mixing, there is a slight residue that forms on the bottom of the mixing tank. This residue represents the insoluble humin mineral components that can be used as a fertiliser after the liquid has been separated and used.",
                    testingMethod: "Humate solubility is a simple comparison that can be done with a bottle of farm water. Add a few grams to the water, shake and leave for 1-2 hours. When you return, check to see if the humate is still in solution. Many \"soluble humates\" sold these days are actually micronized powders of insoluble raw humates and will drop out of suspension within a few minutes of mixing.",
                    applicationComparison: "The process of producing quality, soluble humates is vastly different to the basic mining and crushing of insoluble raw humate ore to produce stable but relatively insoluble, humate powders. One popular humate import has soil application rates of 300-500 lb/acre/annum. This is clearly for the purpose of soil conditioning and will not perform as well for fertiliser management as a highly-soluble humate. Contrast this with NBS Sapphire Granules applied at 5% w/w with dry fertilisers or in the DIY liquid form at 10-12 litres per acre per month (1-1.2 kg of solubilised granules)."

            conclusion: "In summary, at some stage of life we have all learnt the hard way that you get exactly what you pay for. There are useful alternatives in the humate products offered to farmers but remember that each product is priced according to its quality and performance. Humates are available for various purposes but be aware that substituting a lower rate of a cheaper humate product and expecting the superior results of a highly-soluble product will not be possible.",

            introduction: "Post-harvest losses in grapes are important as quality and cost factors make the market more competitive. Post-harvest deterioration of grapes can be due to physical, physiological or pathological factors that may occur in the vineyard (pre-harvest) or after harvest. Loss during harvesting and post-harvest loss is a common phenomenon in grapes due to the perishable nature of the crop. The post-harvest loss in grapes has been recorded by various workers within the range of 8.23 to 16 per cent in the country. Control of the post-harvest losses will help reduce the losses for farmers and enhance the profitability of grape production by way of increased exports.",

                    description: "The major post-harvest fungal damages of grapes in Maharashtra, India during low-temperature storage, are caused by Alternia infections, which occur mainly at the pedicle end, and Cladosporium infections of berries caused by bruising and injuries inflicted during harvesting, handling or transport. At warmer temperatures, Aspergillus infections result in split or cracked berries; infections of Rhizopus stolonifer were observed in grapes which got wet due to pre-harvest rains or water from dew, spray, etc. Alterneria, Claudosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. They were found to be associated with individual berries, while Rhizopus stolonifer was associated with bunch rot. Botrytis rot is not observed in this region.",
                    additionalInfo: "Although the post-harvest losses can be reduced if proper handling and care are taken during harvesting, transporting, cleaning, grading and packing to minimize the injury caused to the berry, complete elimination of the disease is not possible. Giving prophylactic or pre-harvest sprays of chemicals or biological help in reducing the inoculum of fungus on berries, and prompt refrigeration at 0 +_ 0.5°C after harvesting helps in minimising the development of pathogens during transit and storage."

The Hyphae of Trichoderma wrap around the pathogen fungi and produce antibiotics and extracellular enzymes, which lyses the cell wall of these pathogens that damage them. The invading fungus eventually collapses and disintegrates."

The vineyard was maintained with a standard package of practices till 10th April 2019. NBS Singapore supplied the test fungicide, Microshield (Trichoderma viride 1.15% A.S.) Two spray applications of fungicides were carried out. The first spray was given on 2nd April 2019 and the second spray was given on 7th April 2019. The water volume used for spray was calculated based on the requirement of 1000L/ha at the full canopy sprayer used for spray. Knapsack sprayer was used for spray."
