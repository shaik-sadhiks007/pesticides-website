            introduction: [
                "Nutrition is the most enunciated topic spoken around the world, everyone wants to eat nutritious chemical-free food, and farmers also want to produce what is beneficial for their soil and land, a food which is chemical and pesticide-free, their main focus across the world is to get maximum yield with minimum input cost.",

                "The NBS Magic Paddy Kit increased paddy yield by 25%–30% due to its scientifically formulated components. Yield Booster (organic matter, organic carbon, potassium) enhanced soil fertility and nutrient uptake, while Bio Protect (organic matter, mineral potassium, phosphorus) strengthened plant immunity and stress tolerance. Bio Simulator (organic matter, organic carbon) improved microbial activity and root development, and Bug Shield (NPK) ensured a balanced nutrition and defence mechanism. This synergy led to healthier crops, improved grain quality, and higher productivity compared to conventional farming.",
                "The paddy plants treated with the NBS Kit exhibited strong resistance to external stressors, maintaining optimal plant health throughout the trial period. The treated plants demonstrated enhanced vigour, improved immunity, and overall better physiological development, contributing to higher crop resilience and sustainability.",

                "The final crop produced was healthy due to which the use of pesticides was reduced to a minimum, which saved a huge cost to the farmers."

Leonardite is the best quality raw humate as it is found relatively close to the surface and has undergone extensive oxidation to produce the most active organic carbon structure. Lignite brown coal is often sold as humate but it has undergone less oxidation, usually at greater depth, and is inferior in performance to Leonardite humates. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous dealers have tricked farmers into buying finely-ground, black coal as a cheap humate alternative, only to find that it is next to useless."

An important benefit of soluble humates is to magnify and extend the nutrients in expensive, high-analysis fertilisers and trigger the release of soil nutrients previously locked-up by soil chemistry. Without a high degree of solubility, the humates cannot dissolve quickly with the granular fertilisers to act rapidly as a nutrient chelator and buffering agent. If the nutrients are not chelated and buffered quickly (by the action of a highly-soluble humate product) they remain exposed to soil reaction, leaching and volatilisation – a loss of valuable fertiliser during the monsoon and a waste of money for an inferior humate."

                    description: "NBS Sapphire Granules are 85-90% soluble, producing a dark viscous liquid that remains in solution. Upon mixing, there is a slight residue that forms on the bottom of the mixing tank. This residue represents the insoluble humin mineral components that can be used as a fertiliser after the liquid has been separated and used.",
                    testingMethod: "Humate solubility is a simple comparison that can be done with a bottle of farm water. Add a few grams to the water, shake and leave for 1-2 hours. When you return, check to see if the humate is still in solution. Many \"soluble humates\" sold these days are actually micronized powders of insoluble raw humates and will drop out of suspension within a few minutes of mixing.",
                    applicationComparison: "The process of producing quality, soluble humates is vastly different to the basic mining and crushing of insoluble raw humate ore to produce stable but relatively insoluble, humate powders. One popular humate import has soil application rates of 300-500 lb/acre/annum. This is clearly for the purpose of soil conditioning and will not perform as well for fertiliser management as a highly-soluble humate. Contrast this with NBS Sapphire Granules applied at 5% w/w with dry fertilisers or in the DIY liquid form at 10-12 litres per acre per month (1-1.2 kg of solubilised granules)."

            conclusion: "In summary, at some stage of life we have all learnt the hard way that you get exactly what you pay for. There are useful alternatives in the humate products offered to farmers but remember that each product is priced according to its quality and performance. Humates are available for various purposes but be aware that substituting a lower rate of a cheaper humate product and expecting the superior results of a highly-soluble product will not be possible.",

Post-harvest deterioration of grapes can be due to physical, physiological or pathological factors that may occur in the vineyard (pre-harvest) or after harvest. Loss during harvesting and post-harvest loss is a common phenomenon in grapes due to the perishable nature of the crop. The post-harvest loss in grapes has been recorded by various workers within the range of 8.23 to 16 per cent in the country.

At warmer temperatures, Aspergillus infections result in split or cracked berries; infections of Rhizopus stolonifer were observed in grapes which got wet due to pre-harvest rains or water from dew, spray, etc. Alterneria, Claudosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. They were found to be associated with individual berries, while Rhizopus stolonifer was associated with bunch rot. Botrytis rot is not observed in this region.",

Giving prophylactic or pre-harvest sprays of chemicals or biological help in reducing the inoculum of fungus on berries, and prompt refrigeration at 0 +_ 0.5°C after harvesting helps in minimising the development of pathogens during transit and storage."
