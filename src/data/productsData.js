                        description: "NBS SPEED COMPOST™ is a powerful organic manure formulation enriched with cellulolytic composting microbes, including Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus polymyxa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Trichoderma, and Chaetomium. These beneficial microorganisms actively break down organic matter, accelerating the composting process while improving soil fertility. By producing essential enzymes such as cellulases, proteases, and amylases, they efficiently convert raw compost, straw, and organic residues into nutrient-rich humus. This process enhances soil health, boosts microbial diversity, and maximizes nutrient availability, creating an ideal foundation for vigorous plant growth.",
                        suitableFor: "Golf courses, sports fields, ornamental landscapes, and turf renovation projects. Ideal for composting organic waste from turf maintenance, grass clippings, and landscape trimmings to improve soil quality and sustainability.",
